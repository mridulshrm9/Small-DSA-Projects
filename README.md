# Small DSA Projects (C++)

## ðŸ“œ Description

This repository contains a collection of small but fundamental DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) projects implemented in C++.
These projects focus on core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, recursion, arrays, strings, and bitwise operations â€” serving as building blocks for mastering DSA.

| Binary to Decimal Conversion          | Converts a binary number (input as digits) to its decimal equivalent.                             | Loops, Place Value, Powers of 2, Arithmetic           |
| Reverse of Array                      | Reverses the given array in-place using the two-pointer technique.                                | Arrays, Two Pointers, Swapping, Iteration             |
| Array Operations                      | Perform operations like create, view, insert, delete (by value/position), and search in an array. | Arrays, Functions, Linear Search, Insertion, Deletion |
| Binary Search (Recursive & Iterative) | Searches for an element in a sorted array using both recursive and iterative binary search.       | Arrays, Divide & Conquer, Recursion, Iteration        |
| Matrix Operations                     | Implements matrix addition, multiplication, and transpose.                                        | 2D Arrays, Nested Loops, Matrix Arithmetic            |
