# Reverse an Array (C++)

## 📜 Description
This program reverses the elements of an array **in-place** using C++.  
It takes the size and elements of the array as input from the user, then swaps elements from both ends until the array is completely reversed.

---

## 💻 Example Run
Enter the size of array: 5
Enter the value of 1 position: 10
Enter the value of 2 position: 20
Enter the value of 3 position: 30
Enter the value of 4 position: 40
Enter the value of 5 position: 50
The value of 1 position is: 50
The value of 2 position is: 40
The value of 3 position is: 30
The value of 4 position is: 20
The value of 5 position is: 10



## 🔍 Step-by-Step Process (Example: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`)
| Step | start | end | Array after swap |
|------|-------|-----|------------------|
| 1    | 0     | 4   | [50, 20, 30, 40, 10] |
| 2    | 1     | 3   | [50, 40, 30, 20, 10] |
| 3    | 2     | 2   | Stop (array reversed) |

## 🛠️ How It Works
- Two pointers: **`start`** (beginning) and **`end`** (last index).
- Swap elements at `start` and `end`.
- Move `start` forward and `end` backward until they meet.
- Time Complexity: **O(n)**
- Space Complexity: **O(1)** (in-place)
